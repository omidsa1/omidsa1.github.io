# Hello!

I am a research assistant at the University of Kurdistan, where I recently received my B.Sc. in computer engineering. My research interests include multimodal ML for distributed and complex networks (such as IoT and social networks), natural language processing, and data mining and analytics.

## Interests
* Natural Language, Networks and AI fascinate me the most. I raed at least one paper on these topics each night.
* I am an avid hiker. It is something I mainly do for the joy of it; nevertheless, it is quite rewarding.
* I love books, but audiobooks have surpassed paper books and the Kindle as my favorite medium.
