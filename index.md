# Hello!

I am a research assistant at the University of Kurdistan, where I recently received my B.Sc. in computer engineering. My research interests include natural language processing, multimodal ML for distributed and complex networks (such as IoT and social networks), and data mining and analytics.

## Interests
* Networks, natural language and cognition fascinate me the most. I have a routine of reading a paper on these topics each night!
* I am an avid hiker. It is something I mainly do for the joy of it; nevertheless, it is quite rewarding.
* I love non-fiction books and talking to people about their favorite books. Two books I really enjoyed reading recently: Radical Markets by Eric A. Posner and Eric Glen Weyl and Superforecasting by Philip E. Tetlock and Dan Gardner.
