# Hello!

I am a research assistant at the University of Kurdistan, where I recently received my B.Sc. in computer engineering. My research interests include multimodal ML for distributed and complex networks (such as IoT and social networks), natural language processing, and data mining and analytics. 


## Projects
* Sentiment Polarity Analysis of Rotten Tomatoes Movie Reviews - internship [Slides]()
* LDPC: Laplacian Density Peaks Clustering (state-of-the-art seed selection and clustering performance) - bachelor's final project [Code]()
* Capsule Networks: A Review - course project [Slides]() [Document]()
* Regional Activity of Risk Anticipation: A fMRI Study - Neuromatch Academy [Code]() [Slides]()
* Hadoop Ecosystem: Distributed Computing and Big Data - course project [Slides]() [Document]()
* IoT Data Analysis of European Union's MONICA project - University of Kurdistan Internet of Things lab



## Interests
* AI, Natural Language and Networks fascinate me the most. I raed a paper on these topics each night!
* I love books, but audiobooks have surpassed paper books and the Kindle as my favorite medium. 
* I am an avid hiker. It is something I mainly do for the joy of it; nevertheless, it is quite rewarding.
